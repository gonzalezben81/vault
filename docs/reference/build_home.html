* The license page
* A default 404 page if `.github/404.md` is not found.
`build_home_index()` rebuilds just the index page; it's useful for rapidly
iterating when experimenting with site styles.
# Home page
The main content of the home page (`index.html`) is generated from
`pkgdown/index.md`, `index.md`, or `README.md`, in that order.
Most packages will use `README.md` because that's also displayed by GitHub
and CRAN. Use `index.md` if you want your package website to look
different to your README, and use `pkgdown/index.md` if you don't want that
file to live in your package root directory.
If you use `index.Rmd` or `README.Rmd` it's your responsibility to knit
the document to create the corresponding `.md`. pkgdown does not do this
for you because it only touches files in the `doc/` directory.
Extra markdown files in the base directory (e.g. `ROADMAP.md`) or in
`.github/` (e.g. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) are copied by `build_home()` to `docs/` and converted to HTML.
The home page also features a sidebar with information extracted from the
package. You can tweak it via the configuration file, to help make the home
page an as informative as possible landing page.
## Images and figures
If you want to include images in your `README.md`, they must be stored
somewhere in the package so that they can be displayed on the CRAN website.
The best place to put them is `man/figures`. If you are generating figures
with R Markdown, make sure you set up `fig.path` as followed:
``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = &quot;man/figures/&quot;
)
```
This should usually go in a chunk with `include = FALSE`.
```` markdown
```r chunk-name, include=FALSE`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = &quot;man/figures/&quot;
)
```
````
## Package logo
If you have a package logo, you can include it at the top of your README
in a level-one heading:
``` markdown
# pkgdown &amp;lt;img src=&quot;man/figures/logo.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&amp;gt;
```
[init_site()] will also automatically create a favicon set from your package logo.
## YAML config - title and description
By default, the page title and description are extracted automatically from
the `Title` and `Description` fields `DESCRIPTION` (stripping single quotes
off quoted words). CRAN ensures that these fields don't contain phrases
like &quot;R package&quot; because that's obvious on CRAN. To make your package more
findable on search engines, it's good practice to override the `title` and
`description`, thinking about what people might search for:
```yaml
home:
  title: An R package for pool-noodle discovery
  description: &amp;gt;
    Do you love R? Do you love pool-noodles? If so, you might enjoy
    using this package to automatically discover and add pool-noodles
    to your growing collection.
```
(Note the use of YAML's `&amp;gt;` i.e. &quot;YAML pipes&quot;; this is a convenient way of
writing paragraphs of text.)
## Dev badges
pkgdown identifies badges in three ways:
-   Any image-containing links between `&amp;lt;!-- badges: start --&amp;gt;` and
    `&amp;lt;!-- badges: end --&amp;gt;`, as e.g. created by `usethis::use_readme_md()`
    or `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`. There should always be an empty line after
    the `&amp;lt;!-- badges: end --&amp;gt;` line. If you divide badges into paragraphs,
    make sure to add an empty line before the `&amp;lt;!-- badges: end --&amp;gt;` line.
-   Any image-containing links within `&amp;lt;div id=&quot;badges&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;`.
-   Within the first paragraph, if it only contains image-containing links.
Identified badges are **removed** from the _main content_.
They are shown or not in the _sidebar_ depending on the development mode and
sidebar customization, see the sidebar section.
# Authors
By default, pkgdown will display author information in three places:
* the sidebar,
* the left part side of the footer,
* the author page.
This documentation describes how to customise the overall author display.
See `?build_home` and `?build_site` for details about changing the location
of the authors information within the home sidebar and the site footer.
## Authors ORCID and bio
Author ORCID identification numbers in the `DESCRIPTION` are linked using
the ORCID logo:
```r
Authors@R: c(
    person(&quot;Hadley&quot;, &quot;Wickham&quot;, , &quot;hadley@rstudio.com&quot;, role = c(&quot;aut&quot;, &quot;cre&quot;),
      comment = c(ORCID = &quot;0000-0003-4757-117X&quot;)
    ),
    person(&quot;Jay&quot;, &quot;Hesselberth&quot;, role = &quot;aut&quot;,
      comment = c(ORCID = &quot;0000-0002-6299-179X&quot;)
    )
  )
```
If you want to add more details about authors or their involvement with the
package, you can use the comment field, which will be rendered on the
authors page.
```r
Authors@R: c(
    person(&quot;Hadley&quot;, &quot;Wickham&quot;, , &quot;hadley@rstudio.com&quot;, role = c(&quot;aut&quot;, &quot;cre&quot;),
      comment = c(ORCID = &quot;0000-0003-4757-117X&quot;, &quot;Indenter-in-chief&quot;)
    ),
    person(&quot;Jay&quot;, &quot;Hesselberth&quot;, role = &quot;aut&quot;,
      comment = c(ORCID = &quot;0000-0002-6299-179X&quot;)
    )
  )
```
## Additional control via YAML
You can control additinal aspects of the authors display via the `authors`
YAML field:
* display of each author in the footer, sidebar and authors page,
* which authors (by role) are displayed in the sidebar and footer,
* text before authors in the footer,
* text before and after authors in the sidebar,
* text before and after authors on the authors page.
You can modify how each author's name is displayed by adding a subsection
for `authors`. Each entry in `authors` should be named the author's name
(matching `DESCRIPTION`) and can contain `href` and/or `html` fields:
* If `href` is provided, the author's name will be linked to this URL.
* If `html` is provided, it will be shown instead of the author's name.
  This is particularly useful if you want to display the logo of a corporate
  sponsor. Use an absolute URL to an image, not a relative link. Use an empty
  alternative text rather than no alternative text so a screen-reader would
skip over it.
```yaml
authors:
  firstname lastname:
    href: &quot;http://name-website.com&quot;
    html: &quot;&amp;lt;img src='https://website.com/name-picture.png' width=72 alt=''&amp;gt;&quot;
```

By default, the &quot;developers&quot; list shown in the sidebar and footer is
populated by the maintainer (&quot;cre&quot;), authors (&quot;aut&quot;), and funder (&quot;fnd&quot;)
from the `DESCRIPTION`. You could choose other roles for filtering.
With the configuration below:
* only the maintainer and funder(s) appear in the footer, after the text
  &quot;Crafted by&quot;,
* all authors and contributors appear in the sidebar,
* the authors list on the sidebar is preceded and followed by some text,
* the authors list on the authors page is preceded and followed by some text.

```yaml
authors:
  footer:
    roles: [cre, fnd]
    text: &quot;Crafted by&quot;
  sidebar:
    roles: [aut, ctb]
    before: &quot;So *who* does the work?&quot;
    after: &quot;Thanks all!&quot;
  before: &quot;This package is proudly brought to you by:&quot;
  after: &quot;See the [changelog](news/index.html) for other contributors. :pray:&quot;
```
If you want to filter authors based on something else than their roles,
consider using a custom sidebar/footer component
(see `?build_home`/`?build_site`, respectively).
# Sidebar
You can customise the homepage sidebar with the `home.sidebar` field.
It's made up of two pieces: `structure`, which defines the overall layout,
and `components`, which defines what each piece looks like. This organisation
makes it easy to mix and match the pkgdown defaults with your own
customisations.
This is the default structure:
``` yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    structure: [links, license, community, citation, authors, dev]
```
These are drawn from seven built-in components:
-   `links`: automated links generated from `URL` and `BugReports` fields
    from `DESCRIPTION` plus manual links from the `home.links` field:
``` yaml
    home:
      links:
      - text: Link text
        href: https://website.com
      - text: Roadmap
        href: /roadmap.html
    ```
-   `license`: Licensing information if `LICENSE`/`LICENCE` or
    `LICENSE.md`/`LICENCE.md` files are present.
-   `community`: links to to `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`,
    `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, etc.
-   `citation`: link to package citation information. Uses either
    `inst/CITATION` or, if absent, information from the `DESCRIPTION`.
-   `authors`: selected authors from the `DESCRIPTION`.
-   `dev`: development status badges extracted from `README.md`/`index.md`.
    This is only shown for &quot;development&quot; versions of websites; see
    &quot;Development mode&quot; in `?build_site` for details.
-   `toc`: a table of contents for the README (not shown by default).
You can also add your own components, where `text` is markdown text:
``` yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    structure: [authors, custom, toc, dev]
    components:
      custom:
        title: Funding
        text: We are *grateful* for funding!
```
Alternatively, you can provide a ready-made sidebar HTML:
``` yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    html: path-to-sidebar.html
```
Or completely remove it:
``` yaml
home:
  sidebar: FALSE

    <p>`build_home()` function generates pages at the top-level of the site
including:</p>
<p>* The home page
* HTML files from any `.md` files in `./` or `.github/`.
* The authors page (from `DESCRIPTION`)
* The citation page (from `inst/CITATION`, if present).
* The license page
* A default 404 page if `.github/404.md` is not found.</p>
<p>`build_home_index()` rebuilds just the index page; it's useful for rapidly
iterating when experimenting with site styles.</p>
<p># Home page</p>
<p>The main content of the home page (`index.html`) is generated from
`pkgdown/index.md`, `index.md`, or `README.md`, in that order.
Most packages will use `README.md` because that's also displayed by GitHub
and CRAN. Use `index.md` if you want your package website to look
different to your README, and use `pkgdown/index.md` if you don't want that
file to live in your package root directory.</p>
<p>If you use `index.Rmd` or `README.Rmd` it's your responsibility to knit
the document to create the corresponding `.md`. pkgdown does not do this
for you because it only touches files in the `doc/` directory.</p>
<p>Extra markdown files in the base directory (e.g. `ROADMAP.md`) or in
`.github/` (e.g. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) are copied by `build_home()` to `docs/` and converted to HTML.</p>
<p>The home page also features a sidebar with information extracted from the
package. You can tweak it via the configuration file, to help make the home
page an as informative as possible landing page.</p>
<p>## Images and figures</p>
<p>If you want to include images in your `README.md`, they must be stored
somewhere in the package so that they can be displayed on the CRAN website.
The best place to put them is `man/figures`. If you are generating figures
with R Markdown, make sure you set up `fig.path` as followed:</p>
<p>``` r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = "man/figures/"
)
```</p>
<p>This should usually go in a chunk with `include = FALSE`.</p>
<p>```` markdown
```r chunk-name, include=FALSE`r ''`
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.path = "man/figures/"
)
```
````</p>
<p>## Package logo</p>
<p>If you have a package logo, you can include it at the top of your README
in a level-one heading:</p>
<p>``` markdown
# pkgdown &lt;img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" /&gt;
```</p>
<p>[init_site()] will also automatically create a favicon set from your package logo.</p>
<p>## YAML config - title and description</p>
<p>By default, the page title and description are extracted automatically from
the `Title` and `Description` fields `DESCRIPTION` (stripping single quotes
off quoted words). CRAN ensures that these fields don't contain phrases
like "R package" because that's obvious on CRAN. To make your package more
findable on search engines, it's good practice to override the `title` and
`description`, thinking about what people might search for:</p>
<p>```yaml
home:
  title: An R package for pool-noodle discovery
  description: &gt;
    Do you love R? Do you love pool-noodles? If so, you might enjoy
    using this package to automatically discover and add pool-noodles
    to your growing collection.
```</p>
<p>(Note the use of YAML's `&gt;` i.e. "YAML pipes"; this is a convenient way of
writing paragraphs of text.)</p>
<p>## Dev badges</p>
<p>pkgdown identifies badges in three ways:</p>
<p>-   Any image-containing links between `&lt;!-- badges: start --&gt;` and
    `&lt;!-- badges: end --&gt;`, as e.g. created by `usethis::use_readme_md()`
    or `usethis::use_readme_rmd()`. There should always be an empty line after
    the `&lt;!-- badges: end --&gt;` line. If you divide badges into paragraphs,
    make sure to add an empty line before the `&lt;!-- badges: end --&gt;` line.</p>
<p>-   Any image-containing links within `&lt;div id="badges"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`.</p>
<p>-   Within the first paragraph, if it only contains image-containing links.</p>
<p>Identified badges are **removed** from the _main content_.
They are shown or not in the _sidebar_ depending on the development mode and
sidebar customization, see the sidebar section.</p>
<p># Authors</p>
<p>By default, pkgdown will display author information in three places:</p>
<p>* the sidebar,
* the left part side of the footer,
* the author page.</p>
<p>This documentation describes how to customise the overall author display.
See `?build_home` and `?build_site` for details about changing the location
of the authors information within the home sidebar and the site footer.</p>
<p>## Authors ORCID and bio</p>
<p>Author ORCID identification numbers in the `DESCRIPTION` are linked using
the ORCID logo:</p>
<p>```r
Authors@R: c(
    person("Hadley", "Wickham", , "hadley@rstudio.com", role = c("aut", "cre"),
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-4757-117X")
    ),
    person("Jay", "Hesselberth", role = "aut",
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-6299-179X")
    )
  )
```</p>
<p>If you want to add more details about authors or their involvement with the
package, you can use the comment field, which will be rendered on the
authors page.</p>
<p>```r
Authors@R: c(
    person("Hadley", "Wickham", , "hadley@rstudio.com", role = c("aut", "cre"),
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0003-4757-117X", "Indenter-in-chief")
    ),
    person("Jay", "Hesselberth", role = "aut",
      comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-6299-179X")
    )
  )
```</p>
<p>## Additional control via YAML</p>
<p>You can control additinal aspects of the authors display via the `authors`
YAML field:</p>
<p>* display of each author in the footer, sidebar and authors page,
* which authors (by role) are displayed in the sidebar and footer,
* text before authors in the footer,
* text before and after authors in the sidebar,
* text before and after authors on the authors page.</p>
<p>You can modify how each author's name is displayed by adding a subsection
for `authors`. Each entry in `authors` should be named the author's name
(matching `DESCRIPTION`) and can contain `href` and/or `html` fields:</p>
<p>* If `href` is provided, the author's name will be linked to this URL.
* If `html` is provided, it will be shown instead of the author's name.
  This is particularly useful if you want to display the logo of a corporate
  sponsor. Use an absolute URL to an image, not a relative link. Use an empty
  alternative text rather than no alternative text so a screen-reader would
skip over it.</p>
<p>```yaml
authors:
  firstname lastname:
    href: "http://name-website.com"
    html: "&lt;img src='https://website.com/name-picture.png' width=72 alt=''&gt;"
```</p>

<p>By default, the "developers" list shown in the sidebar and footer is
populated by the maintainer ("cre"), authors ("aut"), and funder ("fnd")
from the `DESCRIPTION`. You could choose other roles for filtering.
With the configuration below:</p>
<p>* only the maintainer and funder(s) appear in the footer, after the text
  "Crafted by",
* all authors and contributors appear in the sidebar,
* the authors list on the sidebar is preceded and followed by some text,
* the authors list on the authors page is preceded and followed by some text.</p>

<p>```yaml
authors:
  footer:
    roles: [cre, fnd]
    text: "Crafted by"
  sidebar:
    roles: [aut, ctb]
    before: "So *who* does the work?"
    after: "Thanks all!"
  before: "This package is proudly brought to you by:"
  after: "See the [changelog](news/index.html) for other contributors. :pray:"
```</p>
<p>If you want to filter authors based on something else than their roles,
consider using a custom sidebar/footer component
(see `?build_home`/`?build_site`, respectively).</p>
<p># Sidebar</p>
<p>You can customise the homepage sidebar with the `home.sidebar` field.
It's made up of two pieces: `structure`, which defines the overall layout,
and `components`, which defines what each piece looks like. This organisation
makes it easy to mix and match the pkgdown defaults with your own
customisations.</p>
<p>This is the default structure:</p>
<p>``` yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    structure: [links, license, community, citation, authors, dev]
```</p>
<p>These are drawn from seven built-in components:</p>
<p>-   `links`: automated links generated from `URL` and `BugReports` fields
    from `DESCRIPTION` plus manual links from the `home.links` field:</p>
<p>``` yaml
    home:
      links:
      - text: Link text
        href: https://website.com
      - text: Roadmap
        href: /roadmap.html
    ```</p>
<p>-   `license`: Licensing information if `LICENSE`/`LICENCE` or
    `LICENSE.md`/`LICENCE.md` files are present.</p>
<p>-   `community`: links to to `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`,
    `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, etc.</p>
<p>-   `citation`: link to package citation information. Uses either
    `inst/CITATION` or, if absent, information from the `DESCRIPTION`.</p>
<p>-   `authors`: selected authors from the `DESCRIPTION`.</p>
<p>-   `dev`: development status badges extracted from `README.md`/`index.md`.
    This is only shown for "development" versions of websites; see
    "Development mode" in `?build_site` for details.</p>
<p>-   `toc`: a table of contents for the README (not shown by default).</p>
<p>You can also add your own components, where `text` is markdown text:</p>
<p>``` yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    structure: [authors, custom, toc, dev]
    components:
      custom:
        title: Funding
        text: We are *grateful* for funding!
```</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can provide a ready-made sidebar HTML:</p>
<p>``` yaml
home:
  sidebar:
    html: path-to-sidebar.html
```</p>
<p>Or completely remove it:</p>
<p>``` yaml
home:
  sidebar: FALSE
```</p>
